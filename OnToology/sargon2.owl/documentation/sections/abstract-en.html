<h2>Abstract</h2><div>
    Semantic Web technologies serve as effective solutions to tackle the challenges of heterogeneous data integration across various sectors, including smart energy systems. By providing machine-readable information and facilitating a shared understanding of data for both humans and machines, these technologies enable the linking of domain-specific information. In this interest, ontology is intended to enable heterogeneous systems to communicate using a common language and to understand the same concepts and terms, thereby avoiding varied interpretations of the information being exchanged. To address this issue, we propose the development of SARGON2, an ontology-based framework that extends SARGON to enhance interoperability. By integrating with existing standards such as IEC61970 CIM, SARGON2 incorporates entities related to RES, building domains, and non-energy domains like weather information.
