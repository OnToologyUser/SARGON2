    The transition of power systems has introduced unprecedented changes including in energy demand, grid infrastructure, low carbon landscape and more renewable energy resources (RES). Due to the fact that these power systems highly rely on the digital architecture and also include multiple domains, the interoperability of heterogeneous data across various domains within the energy sector has become a major challenge. To tackle this problem, ontologies are considered as a essential component of the semantic web for providing the knowledge about entities and their relationships in both human and machine-readable formats. This work develops SARGON2 which is an extension of SARGON using a semi-automatic ontology development framework and the schema annotation of the resulting ontology to integrate with the existing standards like Common Information Model (CIM). SARGON2 aims to include the entities such as renewable energy resources (biomass, biogas, geothermal, solar, and wind), building domain, and non-energy domain including weather information.
